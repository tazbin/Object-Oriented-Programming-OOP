Function Overloading VS Function Overriding:

1. Inheritance: Overriding of functions occurs when one class is inherited from another class. 
Overloading can occur without inheritance.

2. Function Signature: Overloaded functions must differ in function signature ie either number 
of parameters or type of parameters should differ. In overriding, function signatures must be same.

3. Scope of functions: Overridden functions are in different scopes; whereas overloaded functions 
are in same scope.

4. Behavior of functions: Overriding is needed when derived class function has to do some added or 
different job than the base class function. Overloading is used to have same name functions which 
behave differently depending upon parameters passed to them.
