Role of access specifiers in encapsulation

As we have seen in above example, access specifiers plays an important role in 
implementing encapsulation in C++. The process of implementing encapsulation can be sub-divided into two steps:

The data members should be labeled as private using the private access specifiers
The member function which manipulates the data members should be labeled as public using the public access specifier
